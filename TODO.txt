BEFORE HANDING IN (IN ORDER): I'm counting on you to do all of this, Wafi
    -Style the code to PEP8 (Should already be done but I made some changes so maybe it unstyled it somewhere)
    -Do a full game run, constantly checking for bugs and bad input handling, killing all bosses, seeing the end screen (Do it on a new save and save often to make sure everything saves correctly)  
    -Format all save files properly
    -Delete this file
    -Delete all unnecessary files
    -Make sure CHANGELOG.md is updated
    -Hand in the game (I have already added the link on Google Classroom, but haven't handed it in yet)
